Detecting Fraud Online Payments Using Ensembling Machine Learning 
Objective:
In this project I used Machine learning models to detect fraudlent behavior.
The Models used were: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and KNeighbor Classifier
We propose a general ensemble-based machine-learning detector that enables the security system to detect fraudlent behavior. To do that, we first train several machine learning models. Then, we use the best-performing models and use them in our ensemble-based detector.
